            <h1>That One Time It Was OK To Slap a Woman</h1>
            <p>Mixed martial arts fighter Shayna Baszler does her walkout to the cage at UFC 177 behind her coach, Josh Barnett. Among other things, she owes him her fighting moniker, the “Queen of Spades.” She looks focused, intent, and very confident. As they reach the cage, her coach stops and turns to face her.</p>
            <p>Josh Barnett, a 255 pound MMA heavyweight whose moniker is the “War Master”, slaps her with the right hand. Then, he slaps her with the left. Baszler, who weighed in the previous day at 135 pounds, shows no more reaction than her head flicking to one side and then the other, absorbing the slaps before flicking forward again.</p>
            <p>The MMA world registers some shock. Watching this from home, I cringe like many others. On the fight night reddit thread, one user comments: “I don’t know if I’m comfortable with this.” He or she receives a slew of upvotes. Someone else comments: “If it was a man he was slapping, we wouldn’t think twice about it”, reminding everyone that this is a warrior they’re looking at, first and foremost, and if anything it’s our negative framing of the slaps that’s sexist.</p>
            <p>Most viewers interpret it as a means for the coach to fire up his protégé, to get her adrenaline flowing and jolt her into full fight mode.</p>
            <p>Whatever you may think about a man publicly slapping a woman literally half his weight, it’s highly probable that Shayna Baszler and Josh Barnett don’t give a shit. She’s about to step into a cage to engage in a bout of physical combat in a sport that's been labeled a “simulated death match”. MMA has few rules and only ends if time runs out or if one fighter exhibits dominance to the point that the other fighter can no longer defend him/herself intelligently.</p>
            <p>Baszler is about to step into the cage, and Barnett is about to sit just outside of it, to continue coaching during the fight, shouting instructions during rounds and stepping into the cage between rounds to proffer water and tactical advice.</p>
            <p>The relationship between coach and fighter is tight, a bond forged through years of training.</p>
            <p>When is a slap not what we normally think of it? When is it not a form of humiliating punishment designed to exert control and express dominance?</p>
            <p>These slaps have other interpretations.</p>
            <p>In the early days of MMA, Josh fought in the Pride Championships in Japan. There, veteran pro wrestler Antonio Inoki is known to publicly slap rising fighters who he feels have a future in the business. It’s a way of imparting luck, but also and more meaningfully a “choosing” of the fighter as a kind of heir, a welcoming into the lineage. Famously, he slapped Lyoto Machida. Inoki slaps are known as “Fighter Spirit” (Toukon) slaps. The first Inoki slap occurred when he was challenged by an amateur fighter and slapped the man to show he wasn't worthy of it. The man famously stood up,  bowed and thanked him for the honor of being slapped by such an illustrious figure. That's when it became a thing. There's a video on internet of Inoki slapping a hundred people in succession, all of them lined up politely waiting their turn and grateful, before and after. </p>
            <p>In France, when a girl has her first period, it’s customary for her mother to slap her. For luck. It’s an acknowledgement that womanhood will bring difficulties and this is just a foretaste of it. Barnett’s slaps are assuredly a foretaste of what will transpire in the cage in the upcoming minutes. The slaps may also seem, in some way, in the logic of fighters which differs in many respects to the logic of the rest of us, a parental mark of affection.</p>
            <p>The camera is pointed at Josh’s back. You can’t see his face, but even so his slaps seemed to say, in a fashion reminiscent of Antonio Inoki, “You are my heir. You and I are one and the same. There’s nothing your opponent can do that you can’t take.”</p>
            <p>Baszler takes the slaps with hardly a blink, her face swinging back to face forward as if mounted on a spring. She bounces on her toes, shaking out pre-fight jitters. She bites down on her mouthpiece, looks at her trainer with ferocious affection. With a silent nod she seems to say, “All I am now I owe you. I carry you with me into the fight.”</p>
            <p>The moment passes. Baszler ascends the steps into the cage. The cage door closes behind her.</p>
