          <p>People in the parlance of the times tend to refer to it as “getting shit done” but I don’t like that choice of terms because “shit” makes me think of poop.</p>
            <p>There are numerous guides and methodologies available today to help bring personal or business projects to fruition. Having developed my own over the years, I humbly share it here with you. Bear in mind that my own formalism caters to my own personality and so you may need to adapt it to yours, as you see fit.

             <p>It’s 2004. She sits cross-legged on the living room floor, puzzle pieces fanned out around her. She hands me a piece.</p>
            <p>“You stay here with me, now. Don’t go smoke a cigarette in the kitchen.”</p>
            <p>“I quit months ago, didn’t you notice? Smoking is all over for me.”</p>
            <p>She shrugs. She cares more if I know where the puzzle piece fits than where it actually does fit. I could do that puzzle with my eyes closed. I hand the piece back to her. “You do it.”

					<div style="margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;width:90%">
						<p>I write magical punk. My stories blend elements of sci-fi and the 
						occasional supernatural element, but never occult the human stories that are my main focus.
						</p>
						<p>
						I always try to maintain an authentic and genuine voice. I frequently read my stories onstage and use that experience
						 to guide my rhythm, pace, theme and delivery.

							<p>Max and Tascha were supposed to be unbreakable as a couple after being conditioned in the Institute for Behavioral Research that took them in as war refugees. Bound to one another, their pre-institute memories wiped clean, they unexpectedly unravel when Tascha finds she wants to see other people.</p>
							<p>Their search for answers and new belonging takes them away from their mountain town, away from their outdoor equipment shop, away from the Extrapolist church, a pseudo-scientific faith in which life is viewed as a meeting place for souls. They go back to the architect of the memory wipe and beyond, to a strange, telepathic monkey who’s been with them the whole time.</p>
							<p>Rialdy comes to work as a consultant in a mining plant on the Aranacian island of Wizniu and looks for traces of his deceased Aranacian mother, meeting a monkey of his own on the way.</p>
							<p>The Memory Monkey is an exploration the nature of human bonds and the untrustworthy nature of memory.</p>

							<strong>The Click Shortcuts</strong> is about the emergence of a writing system in Geremoth, 
							where they use the same writing system as all the other countries on the continent. 
							When mobile phones appear though, Geremoth’s youth start communicating with an alternative system, 
							that imitates sounds. Behind its rise are its fragile-brained inventor Bejia, Anossia who needs it 
							to remain relevant as a student-tutor, Berbi the memorization champion who’ll use it to remember, 
							and Geluko the scientist who needs a source of revenue to promote Besa, the genetically designed crop 
							plant that assaults other crop plants.</p>

							<strong>Puppet Dancers</strong> is my first novel. It is available

						<p>It's a novel about a dance style. Known to Baguetelians as
							the robotic swerve and to Margolians as the puppet dance, its
							history is veiled in legend, but strange events uncovered by data
							analysts will reveal its true function, beyond Baguetelians' ironic
							imitation of laboratory robots or Margolians' nostalgia of lost
							empires.</p>
