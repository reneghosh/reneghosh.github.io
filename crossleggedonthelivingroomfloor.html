	<h1>Cross-Legged on the Living Room Floor</h1>
	<div id="main">
		<p><em>Written 06/02/2018</em></p>
      <p>It’s 2004. She sits cross-legged on the living room floor, puzzle pieces fanned out around her. She hands me a piece.</p>
      <p>“You stay here with me, now. Don’t go smoke a cigarette in the kitchen.”</p>
      <p>“I quit months ago, didn’t you notice? Smoking is all over for me.”</p>
      <p>She shrugs. She cares more if I know where the puzzle piece fits than where it actually does fit. I could do that puzzle with my eyes closed. I hand the piece back to her. “You do it.”</p>
      <p>Her sister is napping in the bedroom. </p>
      <p>She presses the piece into the puzzle, pushing down delicately, not wanting to damage anything.</p>
      <p>...</p>
      <p>It’s 2018. She sits cross-legged in the same spot on the living room floor. There’s a half-full mug of chocolate mixed with almond milk that she says is gross but she’s drinking it anyway, just to keep awake after midnight.</p>
      <p>Her sister is in the bedroom. She’s been asleep for hours.</p>
      <p>I’m on the couch. I just smoked a cigarette. So much for 14-year-old declarations.</p>
      <p>She’s halfway through writing her dissertation about freedom and constraints.</p>
      <p>She asks me, “Give me examples of constraints on freedom that are pure  and not conducive to deeper forms of freedom.”</p>
      <p>Our eyes meet. She cares more to see if I can name any of those constraints to freedom than the constraints themselves.</p>
      <p>I get a better look at her, the way she bundles her hair on top of her head, the talent she has for making eye contact while hiding away all her inner universes behind a bemused curtain. The way she still enjoys the interplay of time-unaware focus and mental wandering.</p>
      <p>“Let’s see,” I say, “social constraints? How about the necessity of linguistic convergence in any human interaction? Or, more to the point, the constraint of having to dissert through the structure of thesis-antithesis-synthesis even if you don’t naturally think that way?”</p>
      <p>She raises her eyebrows, impressed. “Good one,” she says. She writes it down in a margin, carefully. She needs it to be legible later.</p>
      <p>She and I like anything meta. If it’s meta, we will notice it and it will delight us.</p>
      <p>Kids get irritated when you look at them and see babies, but my brain rewards me for it - how would I go about turning that off? It’s a constraint. Everything’s a constraint. Some constraints lead to deeper forms of freedom.</p>
      <p>...</p>
      <p>The puzzle from 2004 sits under a pile of other games that no one ever managed to throw out or give away.</p>
      <p>In a few weeks I’ll have moved out. No more living room carpet sessions watching my elder daughter sit cross-legged, patiently plugging puzzles and dissertations, picking my brains, losing track of time.</p>
      <p>...</p>
      <p>“Let me know if you need to sleep, she says. “I can leave.”</p>
      <p>“No worries,” I say. “If I wanted to sleep I’d just lie down and close my eyes.”</p>
      <p>“What, with all the lights on?”</p>
      <p>“Yeah, that doesn’t bother me.”</p>
      <p>I shrug. I don’t want to sleep. Not right now.</p>
