	<p>The Lindon-Tech portable waterproof supple silicone roll-up bluetooth keyboard.</p>
	<p>I don’t know why I thought I might like it.</p>

	</p>
	<p>Just to get this out of the way and spare you your time if you suspected it might be otherwise: it’s terrible.</p>
	<p>To begin with, I thought it’d be much bigger. Somehow, seeing the form factor on amazon gave me a mental image of what it should look like in real life. In reality, it’s much, much smaller. So small in fact that each key measures only about a centimeter in width. I’m used to typing with all fingers and most thumbs, but that is simply not possible given the cramped keys, so I’m making do with three fingers and zero thumbs.</p>
	<p>This keyboard is basically a silicone skin slapped around a membrane matrix, with no key delimitation other than a vague squarish protuberance over each contact. The lack of any rigidity exacerbates the keypress mushiness. You have to press down hard and straight down on any key in order to trigger it. Never mind trying to develop any rhythm to your typing: the haphazard keypress triggering will have you using the backspace key as much as the space bar, if not more. Unless you are stuck with this keyboard as being the only typing device left on the planet that you can actually afford, you’ll find it quite unusable. A ten minute typing session leaves my fingers feeling aching and depleted, and me wondering if I have arthritis.</p>
	<p>I paid 12,99€ for it on Amazon.</p>
	<p>Typing on this keyboard feels similar to engaging in conversation someone who’s both hard of hearing and has a tenuous grasp of whatever language you happen to be using. It’s frustratingly slow, it’s error-prone, and having to amp up the volume of each syllable makes you angry in spite of your best efforts not to be.</p>
	<p>You wonder, as your fingers arduously carve out one word after another, why any keyboard manufacturer would market this shit. But market it they have, for quite a few years now, so people must be buying them. It’s very easy to point out its shortcomings, so let’s wrack our brains and eke out whatever positives we can find.</p>
	<p>For one, it <em>is</em> rollable. It is very, very small and light, you can fit it in your pocket. And, having held it under a running faucet and used it immediately afterwards, I can confirm that for all intents and purposes it <em>is</em> waterproof.</p>
	<p>And even the difficulties in typing have their purpose. If you want to get better at typing, this keyboard will force you to practice bearing down with precision and force on each key. And all that mushiness means that it’s essentially silent, so shy typists can safely use it without drawing attention to themselves.</p>
	<p>That said, if you enjoy typing in general, it’s highly unlikely that you’ll develop any <em>rapport</em> with this keyboard. The most affectionate thing you’ll ever say about it is “it gets the job done. Sort of.” And no matter how good a typist you are, you’ll hit no speed records and would probably be better off just using the on-screen keyboard of your phone or tablet.</p>
