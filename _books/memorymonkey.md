Max and Tascha were supposed to be unbreakable as a couple after being conditioned in the Institute for Behavioral Research that took them in as war refugees. Bound to one another, their pre-institute memories wiped clean, they unexpectedly unravel when Tascha finds she wants to see other people.

Their search for answers and new belonging takes them away from their mountain town, away from their outdoor equipment shop, away from the Extrapolist church, a pseudo-scientific faith in which life is viewed as a meeting place for souls. They go back to the architect of the memory wipe and beyond, to a strange, telepathic monkey whoâ€™s been with them the whole time.

Rialdy comes to work as a consultant in a mining plant on the Aranacian island of Wizniu and looks for traces of his deceased Aranacian mother, meeting a monkey of his own on the way.

The Memory Monkey is an exploration the nature of human bonds and the untrustworthy nature of memory.
