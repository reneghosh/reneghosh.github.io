	<h1>The "In Your Shoes" Challenge</h1>

            <p>We all know that we live in online echo chambers. We've curated our list of friends and expose ourselves only to links and videos from
people whose political persuasion and moral foundations reflect our own.</p>
            <p>Then, we see the result of a poll or election and think, "what is wrong with people? Where are they getting their news?" We want to reach out 
            and change their minds, but when we reach out to someone we know who's on the other end of the spectrum, conversations turn bitter and hostile.</p>
            <p>If it's a real-life conversation, it turns into a shouting match. We want them to listen to us, but we refuse to be the first to listen.</p>
            <p>Maybe, sometimes, they send us a link to a news article and we take a cursory look, then quickly disregard it and come back to tell them where
            they really should be getting their news from.</p>
            <p>So, I'm creating the "In Your Shoes Challenge", whereby you nominate someone, either on social media, email, or in person, and pledge to read nothing but articles and books THEY recommend, and only watch videos and films from lists THEY curate. You don't have to spend much time at the reading and the viewing, but you do pledge that you will only read and view from those sources.</p>
            <p>If it's a person whose musical tastes you loathe, make it a music challenge and only listen to their playlists or CD or vinyl collection for a week./p>
            <p>Spend a week in another person's shoes. Don't pretend to know where they're coming from until you've been there.</p>
            <p>At the end of the week you <em>could</em> flip the recommendation arrow and have them only read and view and listen to what you've curated, but I think it's a better idea not to go this route but instead have them nominate someone else, chain-style.</p>
            <p>Chances are that, after a week, you'll never want to speak to that person again. But maybe you'll simply have a better understanding of where they're coming from. What's a week, anyway?</p>
